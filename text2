Born and raised in New England, Philip felt a pang of homesickness that sharpened his distaste for the primitive surroundings compared to the civilization he had left. A college student by choice, he regretted not finishing his degree and had moved from New Hampshire six months earlier in search of employment. The economic downturn of 1879 still affected the East, where physical labor was in demand, but not intellectual work.
During this time, an uncle of a college friend helped him secure a clerkship with the Kansas Pacific railway in Kansas City. After six months of routine work at an auditing desk, he faced the consolidation common in the rail industry of the time. Luckily, he was offered a position in either Omaha or Denver. With no strong reason, he chose Denver, partly hoping to find clues about his father, who had vanished years ago under suspicious circumstances.
