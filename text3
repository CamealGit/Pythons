Unable to get a sleeper car, Philip was surprised by the crowd headed to Colorado, drawn by news of a silver discovery in Leadville. Despite preferring books over newspapers, he couldnt ignore the chaos at Kansas City Union Depot. Managing to secure a seat in a day-coach, he found himself surrounded by boisterous treasure-seekers, which contrasted sharply with his reserved New England character.
Most passengers were men, and Philips seatmate was a rough, bearded man who thankfully kept to himself. Across the aisle, poker games and drinking were common sights. Philip felt sympathy for the few women on the train, especially a family that seemed out of place among the rowdy crowd. The family, which included a sick father whose appearance hinted at tuberculosis, was likely traveling to Colorado for health reasons.
Philips attention later shifted to the oldest daughter of the family when a menacing man took the seat next to her after a priest departed. The mans attempts to engage the girl and her discomfort were obvious. Philip, inexperienced with confronting such situations, felt an urge to intervene when the man became more intrusive, eventually offering the girl whiskey. Unsure of what to do, Philip watched as the situation escalated, feeling both anger and helplessness.
